# 🔧 Blue Screen Fix Applied

## ❌ Problem
The Electron window was showing just a blue screen because:
1. Vite was starting on port 5177 (due to ports 5173-5176 being in use)
2. Electron was only trying to load from ports 5173 and 5174
3. When it failed, it tried to load a non-existent `dist/index.html` file

## ✅ Solution Applied

Updated `electron/main.ts` to:
- Try multiple ports (5173-5178) automatically
- Find whichever port Vite is actually running on
- Show console logs to indicate which port loaded successfully
- Better error handling

## 🚀 Changes Made

### Before:
```typescript
const vitePort = process.env.VITE_PORT || '5173';
const viteUrl = `http://localhost:${vitePort}`;
await mainWindow.loadURL(viteUrl);
```

### After:
```typescript
const portsToTry = ['5173', '5174', '5175', '5176', '5177', '5178'];
for (const port of portsToTry) {
  try {
    await mainWindow.loadURL(`http://localhost:${port}`);
    console.log(`✅ Successfully loaded from ${port}`);
    break;
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(`❌ Failed port ${port}, trying next...`);
  }
}
```

## ✅ What Should Happen Now

1. **Vite starts** on any available port (5173-5178)
2. **Electron automatically finds** the correct port
3. **App loads successfully** with full UI
4. **Dev tools open** showing any errors (if they occur)

## 🎯 Expected Result

You should now see:
- ✅ Chat interface on the left
- ✅ Browser view on the right
- ✅ Tab management at the top
- ✅ All UI elements visible (not just blue screen)

## 🐛 If Still Blue Screen

Check the Electron console (it opens automatically) for errors. Common issues:

1. **React import errors** - Check if React is loading
2. **Module not found** - Run `npm install`
3. **TypeScript errors** - Check browser console

## 📝 Files Modified

- ✅ `electron/main.ts` - Added multi-port detection
- ✅ `electron-dist/main.js` - Recompiled with fix
- ✅ `package.json` - Fixed wait-on to only check port 5173

## 🚀 App Should Now Be Running!

The Electron window should open with the full AI Agent Browser interface, ready to use all 17 MCPs!
