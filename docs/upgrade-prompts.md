# Agent Upgrade Prompts

The following prompts outline eight upgrade layers for autonomous agents. They can be pasted into Cursor to scaffold each subsystem in sequence.

## 1. Permissions + Safety Layer
AI-RBAC for agents covering RBAC, PHI boundaries, tenant isolation, safety modes, and documentation.

## 2. Observability + Black Box Logging
Adds structured logging, Supabase tables, analytics, optional UI, and CLI scripts for agent observability.

## 3. Brand & Audience Memory Engine
Introduces persistent brand/persona profiles, loader modules, integrations, and a marketing MCP tool for brand context.

## 4. Closed-Loop Feedback & Optimization
Connects performance data to content generation with new tables, feedback processing, and browser-agent analytics collection.

## 5. Human Review & Approval Dashboard
Provides a review queue, API routes, dashboard UI, and agent gating so publishing requires approval unless forced.

## 6. Render Queue Orchestration
Enhances render jobs with prioritization, worker heartbeats, and queue management for GPU-friendly processing.

## 7. Simulation & Safe Mode Testing
Implements simulation mode to mock write actions, browser submissions, marketing inserts, and exposes a UI toggle.

## 8. Multi-Env & Multi-Tenant Config
Establishes environment profiles, tenant scoping helpers, agent context injection, and UI filters for brand/practice routing.

## 9. Self-Healing Architecture
Introduces health modeling, detection sensors, automated diagnosis and fixes, a learning healing memory, supervisor agent, UI dashboard, and MCP tools for monitoring and repair.
