## 🚀 How to Test

### Option 1: Start the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then use the chat interface to test MCPs naturally.

### Option 2: Test Individual MCPs
```bash
# Test memory server
npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory

# Test sequential thinking
npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking

# Test brave search
npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search
```

### Option 3: Check Configuration
```bash
npx tsx test-config-only.ts
```

## 🎯 Example Usage

Once running, you can ask the AI things like:

- **"Search for recent medical research on diabetes"** → Uses PubMed + Brave Search
- **"Create a presentation about AI in healthcare"** → Uses 2Slides + Sequential Thinking
- **"Help me manage my GitHub repositories"** → Uses GitHub + Memory
- **"Remember this information about my project"** → Uses Memory server
- **"Think through this complex problem step by step"** → Uses Sequential Thinking

## 🔧 Configuration Files Updated

- ✅ `types.ts` - Added environment variable support
- ✅ `services/config.ts` - Added all 17 MCP servers
- ✅ `services/mcp/mcpManager.ts` - Enhanced with env var handling
- ✅ `env.local` - Environment variables file created
- ✅ Test scripts created for verification

## 🎉 Ready to Go!

Your AI Agent Browser now has access to all your MCPs and will automatically:
- Discover available tools
- Route requests to the best MCP server
- Handle environment variables
- Provide intelligent automation

The system is designed to be robust - if some MCPs fail to start, others will continue working. The AI will automatically use whatever tools are available.

**Start testing with: `npm run dev`**
